## The Premise
Heatsweep is a simple head-to-head online board game. Two players rush to connect their starting tiles on a square grid to a random hidden tile on the board (the *sweep*), guided by a red-to-white heat scale on each tile (the *heat*). The target tile is, of course, white-hot.

## Features
Heatsweep includes a lobby, leaderboard (a requirement of the hackathon), and live turn-based gameplay. 

## Todo
- Clean up frontend
- Add proper Django security
- Small-scale cloud deployment
- Game timeout and cleanup
